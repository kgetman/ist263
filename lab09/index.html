        <h1>Katie Getman's Biography</h1>

        <p> 
        Hello! My name is <strong>Katie Getman</strong>, and I’m a graphic design major interested in UI/UX and Immersive Design. I am a third year student, 
        but qualify as a senior because I only have 3 classes left that I will take next Spring. In high school I attended a community 
        college full time my senior year, and was able to graduate with an Associate’s degree allowing me to finish my studies at SU             rather quickly. My minor is in the iSchool as an IM&T track that I have focused on web design related coursework to help with 
        my pursuit of the UI/UX field.  
        </p>

        Outside of school I enjoy being outdoors, and trying new things. I love snowmobiling in the winter, 
        and boating in the summer. I’ve been skydiving twice and plan to pursue getting licensed after college. I recently started 
        snowboarding and would like to spend more time trying to get better!
