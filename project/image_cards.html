  <h3>Snowboarding</h3>
  <p>A recreational and competitive activity that involves descending a snow-covered slope while standing on a snowboard that is almost always attached to a rider's feet. The sport of snowboarding was inspired by skateboarding, sledding, surfing and skiing. It was developed in the United States in the 1960s, and became a Winter Olympic Sport in 1998. Modern snowboarding began in 1965 when Sherman Poppen invented a toy for his daughters by fastening two skis together and attaching a rope to one end so he would have some control as they glided downhill.</p>

  <h3>Scuba Diving</h3>
  <p>A mode of underwater diving where the diver uses an apparatus which is completely independent of surface supply to breathe underwater. The name "scuba", an acronym of "Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus", was first used by Christian J. Lambertsen in a patent submitted in 1952. Scuba divers carry their own source of breathing gas, usually compressed air, allowing them greater independence and freedom of movement than surface-supplied divers, and longer underwater endurance than breath-hold divers.</p>

  <h3>Ice Climbing</h3>
  <p>The activity of ascending inclined ice formations. Usually, ice climbing refers to roped and protected climbing of features such as icefalls, frozen waterfalls, cliffs, and rock slabs covered with ice refrozen from flows of water. For the purposes of climbing, ice can be broadly divided into two spheres, alpine ice and water ice. Alpine ice is found in a mountain environment, usually requires an approach to reach, and is often climbed in an attempt to summit a mountain. Water ice is usually found on a cliff or other outcropping beneath water flows.</p>

  <h3>Skydiving</h3>
  <p>A method of transiting from a high point in the atmosphere to the surface of Earth with the aid of gravity, involving the control of speed during the descent using a parachute or parachutes. It may involve a phase of more or less free-falling, the skydiving segment, which is a period when the parachute has not yet been deployed and the body gradually accelerates to terminal velocity. The first parachute jump in history was made by André-Jacques Garnerin, the inventor of the parachute, on 22 October 1797 by leaping from a hydrogen balloon 3,200 feet above Paris.</p>

  <h3>Mountain Boarding</h3>
  <p>A well established if little-known sport, derived from snowboarding and initially pioneered by James Stanley during a visit in the 1900s to the Matterhorn where snow was not available. A mountainboard is made up of a deck, bindings to secure the rider to the deck, four wheels with pneumatic tires, and two steering mechanisms known as trucks. Mountainboarders ride specifically designed boardercross tracks, slopestyle parks, grass hills, woodlands, gravel tracks, streets, skateparks, ski resorts, BMX courses, and mountain bike trails. </p>

  <h3>Water Skiing</h3>
  <p>A surface water sport in which an individual is pulled behind a boat or a cable ski installation over a body of water, skimming the surface on two skis or one ski. The skier must have adequate upper and lower body strength, muscular endurance, and good balance. There are water skiers around the world. In the United States alone, there are approximately 11 million water skiers and over 900 sanctioned water ski competitions every year. There are many types of skiing including speed skiing, trick skiing, show skiing, slaloming, jumping, barefoot skiing and wakeski.</p>

  <h3>Wakeboarding</h3>
  <p> A water sport in which the rider, standing on a short board with foot bindings, is towed behind a motorboat across its wake and especially up off the crest in order to perform aerial maneuvers. The rider is usually towed behind a boat, but can also be towed by cable systems and winches. A hallmark of wakeboarding is the attempted performance of midair tricks. Wakeboarding was developed from a combination of water skiing, snowboarding and surfing techniques. Competitions take place at the X Games, WWA Wakeboard World Championships, or similar events.</p>

  <div class="container">
  <h3>Barefooting</h3>
  <p>The sport of water skiing behind a motorboat without the use of water skis. Barefooting requires the skier to travel at higher speeds than conventional water skiing. The necessary speed to keep the skier upright varies by the weight of the skier and can be determined by the formula: (Weight(lbs) / 10) + 20, the result is in mph. It is an act performed in show skiing, and on its own. Barefoot water skiing originated in Winter Haven, Florida where 17-year-old A.G. Hancock became the first person ever to barefoot water ski in 1947.</p>

  <h3>Kite Surfing</h3>
  <p>An extreme sport where the kiter uses the wind power with a large power kite to be pulled on a water, land or snow surface. It combines aspects of paragliding, surfing, windsurfing, skateboarding, snowboarding and wakeboarding. After some concepts emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s, some designs were successfully experimented. The sport received a wider audience in the late 1990s with freestyle, wave-riding and racing competitions. Worldwide, there are 1.5 million kitesurfers, while the industry sells around 100,000 to 150,000 kites per year.</p>

  <h3>Parasailing</h3>
  <p>A recreational kiting activity where a person is towed behind a vehicle (usually a boat) while attached to a specially designed canopy wing that resembles a parachute. Land-based parasailing has been transformed into a competition sport in Europe, where the parasail is towed to maximum height behind a 4-wheel-drive vehicle. The driver releases the tow line and the parasailer flies down to a target area in an accuracy competition. The sport was developed in the early 1980s and has been very popular ever since.</p>

  <h3>Luge</h3>
  <p>A small one or two-person sled on which one sleds face up and feet-first. A luger steers by using calf muscles to flex the sled's runners or by exerting opposite shoulder pressure to the seat. Luge is also the name of an Olympic sport. Lugers can reach speeds of 87 mph; Austrian Manuel Pfister reached a top speed of 96 mph on a track in Whistler, Canada, prior to the 2010 Winter Olympics. Lugers compete against a timer in one of the most precisely timed sports in the world—to one thousandth of a second on artificial tracks.</p>

  <h3>Hang Gliding</h3>
  <p>An air sport in which a pilot flies a light, non-motorised foot-launched heavier-than-air aircraft called a hang glider. Most modern hang gliders are made of an aluminium alloy or composite frame covered with synthetic sailcloth to form a wing. Typically the pilot is in a harness suspended from the airframe, and controls the aircraft by shifting body weight in opposition to a control frame. Today pilots have the ability to soar for hours, gain thousands of feet of altitude in thermal updrafts, perform aerobatics, and glide cross-country for hundreds of kilometers.</p>

  <h3>Rock Climbing</h3>
  <p>a sport in which participants climb up, down or across natural rock formations or artificial rock walls. The goal is to reach the summit of a formation or the endpoint of a usually pre-defined route without falling. Rock climbing is a physically and mentally demanding sport, one that often tests a climber's strength, endurance, agility and balance along with mental control. Knowledge of proper climbing techniques and the use of specialized climbing equipment is crucial for the safe completion of routes.</p>

  <h3>Whitewater Rafting</h3>
  <p>A water sport which uses an inflatable raft to navigate a river or other body of water. This is often done on whitewater or different degrees of rough water. Since the 1950s the sport has evolved from individuals paddling 10 to 14 ft rafts with double-bladed paddles or oars, to multi-person rafts propelled by single-bladed paddles and steered by a person at the ster. Rafting on certain sections of rivers is considered an extreme sport and can be fatal. Rafting is also a competitive sport practiced around the world which culminates in a world rafting championship.</p>

  <h3>Surfing</h3>
  <p>A surface water sport in which a surfer uses a board to ride on the face of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found in the ocean, but can also be found in lakes or rivers. There are several types of boards. The Moche of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft. Ancient cultures often surfed on their belly and knees, while the modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer riding a wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.</p>
